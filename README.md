# Hello!

<img src="https://imgur.com/IQQnGTv.gif" style="text-align: right;" alt="Animated Profile Picture">

I develop for fun whenever I can unless I'm gaming of course. 
I prefer programming non-GUI applications 

I mostly focus on C and Python projects but I am trying my best to learn GoLang more.

I LOVE tinkering with hardware and software found in older consoles

I use Gentoo Linux as my main OS since â€” 29/06/2022
