# Hello!

I develop for fun whenever I can unless I'm gaming of course. 
I prefer programming non-GUI applications 

I mostly focus on C and Python projects but I am trying my best to learn GoLang more.

I LOVE tinkering with hardware and software found in older consoles

I use Arch Linux with a custom kernel based on the "linux-ck" kernel.
