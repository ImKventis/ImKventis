# Hello!

I'm studing computer programming and I develop for fun whenever I can unless I'm gaming of course. 
I prefer programming non-GUI applications however I have had some fun helping make sub mods for [Monika After Story](https://github.com/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev) with Ren'Py(Python 2.7)

I mostly focus on Go, C and Python projects but I am trying my best to learn Rust.

I LOVE tinkering with hardware and software found in older consoles

I use Arch Linux with a custom kernel based on the "linux-ck" kernel.
